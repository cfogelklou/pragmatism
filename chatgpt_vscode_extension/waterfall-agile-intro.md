# Waterfall vs Agile

Or: **Do** Sweat the Small Stuff.

## Introduction

Up until the late 90s, all software projects were so-called "Waterfall" projects. The 90s brought XP and TDD, which was the first the world saw of Agile Methodologies.  The Agile Manifesto was released on February 11, 2001, marking a significant turning point in the way software development was approached.

This is VECS, so this talk needs to relate to Automotive Software. Automotive Software was always ,

## Suppliers

## Are Apps "Automotive Software?"

Do we really need to spend 2 weeks verifying the application before release, and only release every 3 months?

## Best Practices - what are they anyway?

What are best practices anyway, when they change every few months? Engineering best practices are more like philosophy, everyone has their own opinion.

### Trunk Based Development

What is Trunk-Based-Development?

We add another widget like all the other widgets this is a good reason for trunk based development. But at Volvo and pull start we are just adding more widgets we are changing the architecture.

## The Details

### Writing Software vs "Writing Software"

2 types of "software" groups in automotive companies. Those that actually write software, and those that make requirements. Make a Seinfeld rental car meme about "writing software" and that doesn't mean what you think it means.


### Developer Experience

What do waterfall and agile have in common? It's very easy to forget developer experience. In Agile we have user stories, in waterfall we map features to dates. In neither case do we have a focus on keeping the teams productive and happy.

### Agile Powerpoint Engineers

When doing waterfall, ever aspect of the design must be defined *in minute detail* before implementation.

Agile spawned the Powerpoint Engineer, someone who took the title of "architect" 15 years ago and doesn't realize that every "certificate" they draw on their slide is an additional 12 man-months of work, plus maintanence to ensure that these certificates can be updated when they expire (which is kind of the point of certificates.)

### Waterfall and Agile: DevEx

Regardless of whether you are using Waterfall, Agile, or Wagile for your project, you **do need to sweat the details.** 

Classic automotive software engineering relied mostly on suppliers to do software development, and the car companies focused on requirement specifications defining each end-to-end function in the car, and how these functions were to be split between the ECUs in the car.

In this mode, car companies didn't need to think about the processes used by their suppliers to write their software, as long as they followed known-good processes, this was fine. Car companies said "when signal B does X, then signal A should do P" and the suppliers put their "Code Monkeys" to work ðŸ™ˆ.

FYI: I have actually heard that term a couple of times while working within automotive and it pissed me off, every time.

"Senior Management" at many auto companies have been accustomed to operating within a supplier-based software environment, characterized by a focus on meeting deadlines through a system of gates and finger-pointing ðŸ‘‰ (at suppliers) when targets were not achieved.

This culture of finger-pointing and "lack of trust" when deadlines are missed doesn't translate well now that car companies have their own internal software teams, but car companies risk taking entirely too long to realize this.

What most of these OEMs didn't realize was that 

This will require a cultural shift within senior management, as they adapt to a more hands-on approach to software engineering. Embracing this change will be crucial for car companies to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving landscape of automotive technology.
