# Merging Waterfall and Agile, or DO Sweat the Details

Merging Agile and Waterfall, or DO Sweat the Details.

- Introduction

  - Waterfall used to be used for all automotive projects
  - Agile was introduced (history?)
  - Manufacturers are trying to be agile, but our timelines are waterfall
  - OEMs have gotten used to expecting their Tier 1 suppliers to deliver on time,
    - Regardless of Tier 1 internal processes.
    - OEMs were only responsible for requirement specifications
  - But now, OEMs must also think about their software processes
    - As OEMs move more and more development in-house, they need to tackle far more details than they did before
    - I hope that this talk will help, in some way to push OEMs and suppliers in the right direction.

- The Old School

  - Waterfall, Gantt Charts, Deadlines...
    - Show a Gantt Chart
    - Show the V diagram and where OEMs used to be involved.
    - Show the gates and stages of a vehicle release (JOB1, VP, TT, SOP, etc)
    - The details of everything at the bottom of the V were not important, the suppliers dealt with that
    - Show a swimlane of features and their delivery expectations (important - will be called back)

- The New School - Waterfall + Agile == WAGILE

  - Waterfall, must meet JOB1, VP, TT, SOP anyway
    - Agile, deliver the highest priority features first, release the backlog with OTA updates.
    - Show a swimlane of features and their delivery expectations (same as Waterfall here)
      - What is missing?
        - Base platform messaging
        - Organization, teambuilding
        - Everything else that is part of "Customer Value Delivery"... that is the point of this talk.

- What is "customer value?"
  - Features? Yes, obviously door locks and remote climate control are customer value.
  - What is not customer value?
    - The colour of the emojis used in your documentation?
    - Quality? Fewer bugs is
