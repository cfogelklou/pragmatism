# Medium Copilot

This will be my debut post on Medium, as I prepare to try to practice to be somewhat of an influencer, maybe.
As I'm new at this, and everyone who is new at something is also bad at that thing, I wanted to cheâ€¦ get some additional help from a co-pilot.

Github Co-pilot was released last year, and I have been using it for day to day coding. My first thought was that if I started "coding"
in markdown here, it would pitch in and help me out. But that didn't happen. Every character you have seen so far has come from my fingertips.

But, all is not lost; I can use my ChatGPT API key! Let's make a VSCode extension to help me write articles.

As one does, let's start with the article at [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

So, I created a subdirectory called chatgpt_vscode_extension and initialized a new extension with

```sh
npx --package yo --package generator-code -- yo code
```

Choosing to call my extension vscode-medium-author-pro

So far, this article has been written by my fingertips and brain alone...
